# YAEP Homebrew Formula

This tap contains a [üç∫ Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formula for the Earley parser [YAEP](https://github.com/vnmakarov/yaep). It is currently based on a fork of YAEP, since the [official repository does not list a released version of the parsing engine](https://github.com/vnmakarov/yaep/issues/22).

## Installation

To install YAEP just use enter the two shell commands listed below:

```sh
brew tap sanssecours/yaep
brew install yaep
```

.

## Troubleshooting

To check if the installation was successful please use the command `brew test yaep`.
